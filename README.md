# iOS-Weather-App

Inspired by the deafult iOS weather application, Clima is a weather app built from scratch using Swift which allows a user to be able to check the weather for their current location based on the GPS data from their iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually. Live weather data is fetched using API calls from the internet. 

Users can choose the theme of the application as being in Light Mode or Dark Mode based on their preference.
